# OpenLMIS Order Service
This repository holds the files for the OpenLMIS Order Independent Service.

## Prerequisites
* Docker 1.11+
* Docker Compose 1.6+

## <a name="quickstart">Quick Start</a>
1. Fork/clone this repository from GitHub.

 ```shell
 git clone https://github.com/OpenLMIS/openlmis-order.git
 ```
2. Add an environment file called `.env` to the root folder of the project, with the required 
project settings and credentials. For a starter environment file, you can use [this 
one](https://github.com/OpenLMIS/openlmis-config/blob/master/.env). e.g.

 ```shell
 cd openlmis-order
 curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLMIS/openlmis-config/master/.env
 ```
3. Develop w/ Docker by running `docker-compose run --service-ports order`.
See [Developing w/ Docker](#devdocker). You should now be in an interactive shell inside
the newly created development environment.
4. Run `gradle build` to build. After the build steps finish, you should see 'Build Successful'.
5. Start the service with `gradle bootRun`. Once it is running, you should see
'Started Application in NN seconds'. Your console will not return to a prompt as long as
the service is running. The service may write errors and other output to your console.
6. You must authenticate to get a valid `access_token` before you can use the service.
Follow the [Security](https://github.com/OpenLMIS/openlmis-example/blob/master/README.md#security)
instructions to generate a POST request to the authorization server at `http://localhost:8081/`.
You can use a tool like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to generate the POST.
The authorization server will return an `access_token` which you must save for use on requests to
this OpenLMIS service. The token will expire with age, so be ready to do this step often.
7. Go to `http://localhost:8080/?access_token=<yourAccessToken>` to see the service name and version.
Note: If localhost does not work, the docker container with the service running might not be
bridged to your host workstation. In that case, you can determine your Docker IP address by
running `docker-machine ip` and then visit `http://<yourDockerIPAddress>:8080/`.
8. Go to `http://localhost:8080/index.html?access_token=<yourAccessToken>` to see the Swagger UI showing the API endpoints.
(Click 'default' to expand the list.)
9. Use URLs of the form `http://localhost:8080/api/*?access_token=<yourAccessToken>` to hit
the APIs directly.

## Stopping the Service
To stop the service (when it is running with `gradle bootRun`) use Control-C.

To clean up unwanted Docker containers, see the [Docker Cheat Sheet](https://openlmis.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OP/Docker+Cheat+Sheet#DockerCheatSheet-Cleaningup:).

### Docker's file details
See the Docker's file details section in the Service Template README at
https://github.com/OpenLMIS/openlmis-template-service/blob/master/README.md#dockerfiles.

### Running complete application with nginx proxy
See the Running complete application with nginx proxy section in the Service Template README at
https://github.com/OpenLMIS/openlmis-template-service/blob/master/README.md#nginx.

### Logging
See the Logging section in the Service Template README at 
https://github.com/OpenLMIS/openlmis-template-service/blob/master/README.md#logging.

### Internationalization (i18n)
See the Internationalization section in the Service Template README at 
https://github.com/OpenLMIS/openlmis-template-service/blob/master/README.md#internationalization.

### Debugging
See the Debugging section in the Service Template README at
https://github.com/OpenLMIS/openlmis-template-service/blob/master/README.md#debugging.

### Demo Data
You can use a standard data set for demonstration purposes. To do so, first follow the Quick Start
until step 3 is done: https://github.com/OpenLMIS/openlmis-order/blob/master/README.md#quickstart.
Then, before `gradle bootRun`, use `gradle demoDataSeed`. This will generate a sql input file under
`./demo-data` directory.

To insert this data into the database, finish the Quick Start steps,
and then outside of container's interactive shell, run:
`docker exec -i openlmisorder_db_1 psql -Upostgres open_lmis < demo-data/input.sql`
